use data sheet from WEB site for Command values.

ZETA library is for SPI bus only serial  port is reserved for sending data received to a terminal program.  		
	
Commands in Library:
	
Init();
	configures SPI bus and serial to 19200 also configures all Used IO on Arduino-UNO 
	call in Void setup. 
	
	

Wait_IRQ():
	call after entering RX mode. it waits for the IRQ line to go LOW indicating a packet was
	received and ready to be processed.

	
Zeta_Ready();
	called after Init in void setup. 
	this waits for the CODEC to Finnish configuring the ZETA
	indicates when the CODEC is ready for SPI communication.
	both TX_LED and RX_LED Will be on while this command is waiting.

	
Select_Mode(Mode);
	put the Zeta in to a selected mode see data sheet for commands all values 
	for this command are in HEX eg. ZETA.Select_Mode(0X02);
	
	
RX_Mode(Ch, PLength);
	puts the ZETA in receive Mode with selectable channel and packet length
	Ch      = Channel
	PLength = Length of data packet  
	
	eg.	ZETA.RX_Mode(0x00, 0x0C); 
	this will put the ZETA in RX mode waiting for a 12byte packet on channel 0X00
	all all values are in HEX see data sheet
		

Set_RF_Baud(Baud);
	set the speed the RF sends a packet both TX and RX must have the same setting to work
	see data sheet for values all in HEX.
	

	
Sync_Byte(Sync1, Sync2, Sync3, Sync4);
	 select RF Sync bytes This is so the RX knows when its being talked to see data sheet.   
	
	if not used send 0XAA as the Unused sync byte
	if only using 3 bytes use 2, 3, 4. 
	if only using 2 bytes use 3, 4.  
	if only using 1 byte use  4.
		

Send_Packet(Ch, PLength);
	starts the send command this must be followed by Write_Byte command o send packet
	to Transmit RF See example TX code. 	
	
 	Ch      = Channel
	PLength = Length of data packet
	
	
Write_Byte(TxByte);
	called after Send_Packet this writes one byte of data to the TX FIFO ready for sending	
	call this till all the data you need to send is done. 
	
	
	
Close_Send();	
	called after Write_Byte has been Finnish this tells the CODEC its ready to 
	send the Data in its FIFO.	
	
	
	
Get_Packet();
	this command returns nothing all this dose is send the received packet out to a terminal program 
	this routine works out the packet length then sends all received data out via serial baud 19200
	
	
	
Get_RX_Byte(return RxByte);
	this reads one Byte of data from the FIFO of the CODEC loop this command till all data
    has been read see ZETA-LIB-RX sample on how to use this command
